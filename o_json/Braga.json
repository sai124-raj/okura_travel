  "description":"<e class='first-big'>B</e>raga has a multitude of touristic offer that is able to respond to multiple demands and interests. It is a city with an unusual history, still known up to today as the city of the Archbishops (which is explained because for centuries - almost since the beginnings of the Portuguese nationality and until the eighteenth century – the Archbishops were holders, regarding the city, of both temporal and spiritual power), or known as the Portuguese Rome, because of the faith of its people, for its number of religious manifestations (up to today the Holy Week is the highlight of the tourist flow), the number of churches and shrines spread by the entire city and its surrounding territory (besides the Cathedral, the Church of Bom Jesus and the Sanctuary of Sameiro there is a huge amount of beautiful religious buildings)",
